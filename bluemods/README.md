# BlueMods AntiCheat  

BlueMods AntiCheat for Minecraft Bedrock is a powerful tool designed to protect your server from hackers & cheaters

## ⚠️ Limitations  

The prevention system in our addon is **basic**, meaning not all exploits or cheat movements can be completely prevented. While it helps reduce unfair advantages, more advanced hacks may still bypass some detections.  

## 🚀 Features  

- Detects and blocks common cheats such as illegal items, crasher, and invalid namespoof.  
- Customizable settings for server owners to fine-tune protection.  
- Regular updates to improve detection and prevention methods.  

## 📌 Installation  

1. Download the latest release from our [official website](https://bluemods.neocities.org) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BlueModsYT/BlueMods/releases).  

## 🔧 Configuration  

The addon includes a configuration panel where you can enable or disable specific detections. Modify the settings to suit your server's needs.  

## 📢 Future Improvements  

We are actively working on enhancing the detection system to cover more exploits and provide better security for servers. If you have suggestions or encounter issues, feel free to contribute or report them on our GitHub.
